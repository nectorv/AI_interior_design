"""Tests for Lambda search service.

Note: lambda_search_service.py contains LambdaFurnitureSearcher class which
is functionally identical to QdrantService. Tests for this service are covered
by test_qdrant_service.py. This module uses the same backend and follows the
same patterns, so separate tests would be redundant.
